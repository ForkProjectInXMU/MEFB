# MEFB: Benchmarking and Comparing Multi-exposure Image Fusion Algorithms
This is the official webpage of MEFB, which is a multi-exposure image fusion benchmark.

**MEFB is the first benchmark in the field of multi-exposure image fusion (MEF)**, aiming to provide a platform to perform fair and comprehensive performance comparision of MEF methods. Currently, **100 image pairs, 21 fusion algorithms and 20 evaluation metrics** are integrated in MEFB, which can be utilized to compare performances conveniently. All the fusion results are also available that can be used by users directly. In addition, more test images, fusion algorithms (in Matlab), evaluation metrics and fused images can be easily added using the provided toolkit.

## Abstract
Multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) is an important area in computer vision and has attracted increasing
interests in recent years. Apart from conventional algorithms, deep learning techniques have also been
applied to MEF. However, although many efforts have been made on developing MEF algorithms, the lack
of benchmarking studies makes it difficult to perform fair and comprehensive performance comparison among
MEF algorithms, thus hindering the development of this field significantly. In this paper, we fill this gap by
proposing a benchmark of multi-exposure image fusion (MEFB), which consists of a test set of 100 image pairs,
a code library of 21 algorithms, 20 evaluation metrics, 2100 fused images, and a software toolkit. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first benchmarking study in the field of MEF. This paper also gives a literature
review on MEF methods with a focus on deep learning-based algorithms. Extensive experiments have been
conducted using MEFB for comprehensive performance evaluation and for identifying effective algorithms.
We expect that MEFB will serve as an effective platform for researchers to compare the performance of MEF
algorithms.
